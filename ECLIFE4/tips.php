                                       <h2>Why is it important to eat vegetables?</h2>
                                       <p>Eating vegetables provides health benefits — people who eat more vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. Vegetables provide nutrients vital for health and maintenance of your body.</p>

                                       <h3>Nutrients</h3>
                            <p>Most vegetables are naturally <strong>LOW </strong>in fat and calories. None have cholesterol. (Sauces or seasonings may add fat, calories, and/or cholesterol.)</p><br>
                            <p><strong>Vegetables</strong> are important sources of many nutrients, including potassium, dietary fiber, folate (folic acid), vitamin A, and vitamin C.</p><br>
                            <p><strong>Diets rich in potassium</strong> may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Vegetable sources of potassium include sweet potatoes, white potatoes, white beans, tomato products (paste, sauce, and juice), beet greens, soybeans, lima beans, spinach, lentils, and kidney beans. </p><br>
                            <p><strong>Dietary fiber from vegetables</strong>, as part of an overall healthy diet, helps reduce blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart disease. Fiber is important for proper bowel function. It helps reduce constipation and diverticulosis. Fiber-containing foods such as vegetables help provide a feeling of fullness with fewer calories. </p><br>
                            <p><strong>Folate (folic acid)</strong> helps the body form red blood cells. Women of childbearing age who may become pregnant should consume adequate folate from foods, and in addition 400 mcg of synthetic folic acid from fortified foods or supplements. This reduces the risk of neural tube defects, spina bifida, and anencephaly during fetal development.</p><br>
                           <p> <strong>Vitamin A </strong>keeps eyes and skin healthy and helps to protect against infections.</p><br>
                            <p><strong>Vitamin C </strong>helps heal cuts and wounds and keeps teeth and gums healthy. Vitamin C aids in iron absorption.</p><br>
 
                                    <h3>Health benefits</h3>
                            <p>As part of an overall healthy diet, <strong>eating foods such as vegetables that are lower in calories </strong>per cup instead of some other higher-calorie food may be useful in helping to lower calorie intake.</p><br>
                            <p><strong>Eating a diet rich in vegetables and fruits</strong> as part of an overall healthy diet may reduce risk for heart disease, including heart attack and stroke.</p><br>
                            <p><strong>Eating a diet rich in some vegetables and fruits</strong> as part of an overall healthy diet may protect against certain types of cancers.</p><br>
                            <p><strong>Adding vegetables</strong> can help increase intake of fiber and potassium, which are important nutrients that many Americans do not get enough of in their diet.</p><br>

                                       <h2>Why fruits?</h2>
                                       <p>Fruits are nature’s marvelous gift to the humankind; indeed, they are life-enhancing medicines packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and many phytonutrients (Plant-derived micronutrients).

                            <p>Fruits provide plenty of soluble dietary fiber, which helps to ward off cholesterol and fats from the body and to help in smooth bowel movements as well as offer relief from constipation ailments.C.</p><br>
                            <p>Fruits compose of many antioxidants such as polyphenolic flavonoids, vitamin-C, and anthocyanins. These compounds, firstly help human body protected from oxidant stress, diseases, and cancers, and secondly; assist the body in developing the capacity to fight against these ailments by boosting our immunity level. Many fruits, when compared to vegetables and cereals, have very high anti-oxidant values, which measured regarding their "Oxygen Radical Absorbent Capacity" or (ORAC).</p><br>

                            <p>Anthocyanins are flavonoid category of polyphenolic compounds found in some "blue-fruits" like blue-black grapes, mulberries, acai berry, chokeberry, blueberries, blackberries, and in many vegetables featuring blue or deep purple pigments. Consumption of fruits rich in blue pigments offers many health benefits. These compounds have potent antioxidant properties that help remove free radicals from the body, and thus provide protection against cancers, aging, and infections. A majority of these pigments in the fruits tend to concentrate just underneath their skin.</p><br>

                            <p>Fruit’s health benefiting properties are because of their richness in vitamins, minerals, micro-nutrients, pigment anti-oxidants. Altogether, these compounds help the body prevent or at least prolong the natural changes of aging by protecting from damage and rejuvenating cells, tissues, and organs.</p><br>

                                       <h2>Why Root Crops?</h2>
                                       <p>The main nutritional value of roots and tubers lies in their potential ability to provide one of the cheapest sources of dietary energy, in the form of carbohydrates, in developing countries. This energy is about one-third of that of an equivalent weight of grain, such as rice or wheat, because tubers have a high water content.</p>

                                       <h2>Why Rice?</h2>
                                       <p>Rice is a starchy grain used as a staple ingredient by more than half the world's population largely due to its versatility, availability, and ability to adapt to any flavor and seasoning. Rice has a chewiness and soft texture that adds substance to meals and complements many cuisines.</p>

                                       <h3>Nutrients</h3>
                            <p>There are over 53 grams of carbohydrate in a single serving of white rice. Only a tiny amount of that carbohydrate comes from fiber. Most of it is starch and a small amount is sugar.
                            </p><br>
                            <p>The glycemic index of white rice is estimated to be 73. The glycemic index of brown rice, on the other hand, is estimated to be about 68. Short-grain rice tends to have a higher glycemic index than long-grain, medium-grain, and brown rice.</p><br>
                            <p>Brown rice also has fewer carbohydrates than white rice at 49.6g per cup<p>
                            <p>All rice is originally whole-grain, with the bran attached. White rice is produced by pearling, which is a process through which the grain passes through a machine where it is rolled and the bran is gently "pearled" off, leaving the white kernel intact. This makes the grain a processed, refined grain, no longer a whole grain. Pearling also lowers the cooking time and extends the shelf life of grains.</p><br>
                            <p>Rice can serve as a good source of B vitamins (including thiamin, niacin, and riboflavin) and iron. Rice is also an excellent source of manganese and magnesium.</p>
